A curated collection of Python scripts illustrating core AI techniques applied to healthcare, based on CS50’s Artificial Intelligence with Python curriculum.



**Overview**

Brief examples demonstrating:

Search & Knowledge: Informed search, rule-based inference, and knowledge-base reasoning.

Uncertainty: Bayesian networks, Markov chains, and hidden Markov models for probabilistic patient modeling.

Optimization: Local search, linear programming, and constraint satisfaction for resource allocation and scheduling.

Learning: Supervised (KNN, linear regression, perceptron, SVM) and unsupervised (k‑means clustering) methods for diagnosis and patient segmentation.

**Getting Started**



Clone & Install

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-healthcare-examples.git
cd ai-healthcare-examples

Best Practices
Use virtual environments (venv, conda).

Fix random seeds for reproducibility.

Document code with comments and logging.

Visualize results for interpretability.
